**METHODS & GESTURES:**<br/>
Gestures:<br/>
*Index finger is always the finger that is tracked* <br/>
1 finger for moving mouse<br/>
2 fingers for clicking<br/>
--> Left click: Bring thumb into hand<br/>
  --> Dragging: Bring thumb into hand and move (while keeping thumb pressed down onto hand)<br/>
--> Right click: Press thumb & index together<br/>
Fist for scrolling: 
<br/>
<br/>
Methods:<br/>
Wear black glove and surround the thumb and index finger with tape that's colored pink<br/>
Convert image to HSV (capture only black objects)<br/>
Contour detect in order to find largest surface area (which will - hopefully - be the glove)<br/>
Find valleys and mountains of the hand
The coordinates of each mountain are the fingers

_Initialization_:<br/>
Hand is shown outstrechted (three fingers only), algorithm identifies fingers
